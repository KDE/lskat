<FONT SIZE="+1"><b>Overview</b></FONT>
<p>
Lieutnant skat (from German <i>Offiziersskat</i>) is a card
game for two player. It is roughly played according to the
rules of <i>Skat</i> but with only two players and simplified
rules.
<br>
Every player has a set of cards in front of him/her, half of
them covered and half of them open. Both players try 
to win more than 60 of the 120 possible points. After 16
moves all cards are played and the game ends.

<p>
The game has a randomly chosen trump card. It is shown as a
small suit symbol in the upper right corner of the score
field. All four Jacks are also counted as trumps and do <b>
not</b> belong to their suits. So if <i>heart</i> is trump
all seven hearts as well as all four Jacks count as trumps,
making 11 trumps. E.g. the Jack of clubs does not count as
<i>club</i> but as trump.
<br>
A special trump is the <i>Grand</i>. In this game no suit is
trump and only the four Jacks count as trump. In the game this
is indicated by the symbol of the Jack's head.
<p>
Every player owns 16 cards. 8 of them covered 8 of them
open. The start player can play any of his/her open cards.
<p>
The second player has following choices:
<OL>
<LI> The second player has in his/her open cards the same suit.
     He/she has to play one of this suit then. The player with
	   the higher card (see table below) wins both cards.
<LI> The second player does not have a card of the played suit.
     He/she can now play any other card. If it is a trump the
	   second player will win both cards. Otherwise the
	   first player will win both cards.
</OL>

<p>
If there is still a covered card below a played card it will
be uncovered and is from now on an open card.
<p>
The player who won the cards can make the next turn.

<p>
The sequence of the cards (from the highest to the lowest -
holding for any <b>trump</b>):
<br>
Jack of clubs, Jack of spades, Jack of hearts, Jack of diamonds,
Ace, Ten, King, Queen, Nine, Eight, Seven.
<p>

The player who wins both cards will add their value to his score.

<P>

It is possible to play the game over a network connection
with another computer. To do so both player on both computers
have to select one colour played by a human player and the
other by the remote player. Who chooses which side does not
matter. It even does not matter if both choose to play the same
player as this will automatically be interchanged by the game.
<p>
One of the computers will act as game server. Only this one can
start a new network game. Also all its game data will be transfered
to the client computer.
You can force your computer to be server if you do not supply
a hostname in the network dialog. This dialog pops up if you
start a new network game. As a client you enter the hostname of
the machine the server is running. The port needs usually not be
changed. But you can enter nearly any number there.
